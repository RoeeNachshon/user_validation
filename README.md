Detailed description of the system (characterization)
Detailed System Description
The proposed system utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to achieve its objectives.
CNN:
The CNN component of the system is designed to identify simple patterns within the input data. It is particularly effective in extracting features from shorter segments of the overall dataset, making it suitable for analyzing time sequences. A 1D CNN, in this case, is employed as it moves vertically across the input data, capturing patterns in a hierarchical manner. By leveraging the hierarchical pattern recognition capabilities of CNN, the system can identify complex patterns within the input data. 
RNN: 
The RNN component of the system addresses the challenges of handling sequential data and incorporating the influence of previous inputs. RNNs are designed to save the output of a particular layer and feed it back as input, enabling the prediction of the output based on the current and previous inputs. By utilizing the internal memory mechanism of RNNs, the system can memorize and consider the context of previous inputs, which is crucial for analyzing time sequences. The use of RNN architecture, such as LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units), further enhances the ability to retain relevant information and make predictions.
LSTM:
LSTM is a specific type of RNN architecture employed in the system. It addresses the issue of short-term memory by introducing the concept of a cell state and various gates. The cell state acts as a highway that propagates information throughout the entire sequence chain, enabling the network to retain and propagate relevant information. The gates in LSTM, such as the forget gate, input gate, and output gate, allow the network to regulate the flow of information and selectively remember or forget information at each time step. This mechanism enables the LSTM to capture long-term dependencies and make predictions based on the learned patterns. 
By combining CNN, RNN (specifically LSTM), and their respective capabilities, the system can effectively analyze and extract features from time sequences, capturing both simple and complex patterns within the input data. The CNN component identifies basic patterns, which are then integrated and processed by the RNN/LSTM component to capture long-term dependencies and make accurate predictions based on the learned patterns.

The algorithmic problem involves finding an effective approach to recognize and differentiate between authorized and unauthorized users based on their typing behavior. Here is an overview of the formulation, existing algorithms, and the chosen solution in the project:
•	Formulation and Analysis of the Algorithmic Problem:
•	The algorithmic problem in this project revolves around developing a model that can accurately classify and authenticate users based on their typing patterns.
•	It requires analyzing various features of typing behavior, such as key press timings, key hold durations, and inter-key intervals, to capture the unique characteristics of individual users.
•	It is very hard to find anomalies while giving the model enough data to learn the behavior of the subject.
•	Description of Existing Algorithms to Solve the Problem:
•	Initially, the project explored the use of popular machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Forests.
•	KNN algorithm attempts to classify users based on the similarity of their typing patterns to previously observed patterns in the training data.
•	Decision Forests (e.g., Random Forest) employ an ensemble of decision trees to classify users based on various features of their typing behavior.

Description of the Communication Protocol
In the Typing Pattern Detection AI system, there is a need for communication between different components, such as the user interface, data processing modules, and the machine learning model. However, in the specific project you described, there is no explicit communication protocol or messaging system mentioned. Therefore, there are no structured messages flowing within the system.
It is important to note that the absence of a communication protocol in your project does not necessarily imply a limitation. The lack of a specific protocol indicates that the components interact directly or rely on function calls and data passing within the program without a standardized messaging format.
Instead of a structured messaging system, the different components of the system interact through function calls, method invocations, and data sharing within the program itself. For example, the user interface module may call functions from the data processing module to process the collected typing data, normalize it, and train the machine learning model. The trained model can then be used for authentication purposes.
Without a specific communication protocol, the system architecture relies on direct interaction and integration of the components, allowing for a more seamless flow of data and control within the program. However, if future expansions or integrations require inter-component communication, it may be necessary to consider implementing a structured communication protocol to ensure efficient and standardized data exchange between the components.

Username Input Screen: The first screen is a simple interface where the user is prompted to enter their username. It typically consists of a text input field where the user can enter their username and a submit button to proceed to the next screen. This screen serves to identify the user and associate their input with their unique identifier.
Recording Option Screen: The second screen presents the user with two radio buttons, allowing them to choose whether they want to record their input or not. This screen is designed to give the user control over whether their typing patterns will be captured and used by the system. If the user decides not to record their input, the system may display a message to inform them that their input will not be stored.
It's important to note that if the user doesn't exit the system properly, i.e., by submitting their username and choosing the recording option, the system may display a warning or reminder to ensure the user takes the necessary actions.
Output Screen: The third screen is the main output interface of the system. It typically displays the predictions generated by the trained model based on the user's typing patterns. This screen may include an output box where the predicted values or text is displayed, providing the user with real-time feedback or information based on their typing behavior. The screen may also include additional elements, such as a text indicator or visual cues, to indicate the system's decision or classification based on the user's input.
Overall, these three screens provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the users to interact with the system, enter their username, choose whether to record their input, and view the predictions or outputs generated by the AI model.
Description of the Data Structures
The Typing Pattern Detection AI system utilizes various data structures to store and process different types of information. Here is a breakdown of the data structures involved:
1.	Initial Users Database (txt file):
•	This database contains the typing patterns of multiple users and serves as the initial reference for user authentication.
•	The structure of each record in the database is an array with the following fields:
•	Key 1: The first key pressed by the user.
•	Key 2: The second key pressed by the user.
•	Timing Float 1: A float value representing the timing or duration of the first key press.
•	Timing Float 2: A float value representing the timing or duration of the second key press.
•	Timing Float 3: A float value representing the timing or duration between the first and second key presses.
•	Timing Float 4: A float value representing the timing or duration between the second and third key presses.
•	Example values for a record in the initial users database: [164, 9, 0.219, 0.124, 0.11, -0.109]
2.	Main User Database (txt file):
•	This database contains the typing patterns of the main user who is currently using the system.
•	Similar to the initial users database, each record in this database has the following structure:
•	Key 1: The first key pressed by the main user.
•	Key 2: The second key pressed by the main user.
•	Timing Float 1: A float value representing the timing or duration of the first key press.
•	Timing Float 2: A float value representing the timing or duration of the second key press.
•	Timing Float 3: A float value representing the timing or duration between the first and second key presses.
•	Timing Float 4: A float value representing the timing or duration between the second and third key presses.
•	Example values for a record in the main user database: [78, 79, 0.14441466331481934, 0.12945318222045898, 0.0945744514465332, -0.04984021186828613]
3.	Normalized Data (h5 file):
•	After processing and normalizing the typing patterns, the data is saved in an h5 file format.
•	The structure and organization of the normalized data may depend on the specific requirements and techniques used for normalization.
4.	Trained Model (h5 file):
•	The trained machine learning model, which is used for identifying and authenticating typing patterns, is saved in an h5 file format.
•	The exact structure and organization of the model depend on the chosen architecture and the framework used for training, such as Keras.
It is important to note that the specific details and structure of the databases and files may vary based on the implementation and requirements of the Typing Pattern Detection AI system. The provided examples give a general idea of the fields and values involved in the data structures but may not reflect the entire complexity of the system's data representation.

It is important to note that the system does not include additional self-developed modules or departments beyond these imported libraries.

Solving the algorithmic problems
•	I found that the data distributed the most in the “hold times” of each user. That way it is the most informative section of the data.  
•	Also, I have learned that the best way to pack the data is using “sliding window”. To obtain more data, I iterated over it and created blocks that are the size of 30 tuples from every position, which I call a window. At the time the data is collected or converted, the key ID’s values are between 0 - 254, so we normalize them by dividing them by 254. The final process is to label all the data and reshape the data so it will fit the model specifications. 
•	Keras Models Sequential:
First, we have one 1D Conv layer with 32 features and a kernel size of 2, then 2 LSTM layers with 32 units and a dropout of 0.5 after each LSTM layer. The results are as follows: 
The choice of using Keras Models Sequential was justified based on the need for a more sophisticated and adaptable approach to accurately identify and authenticate users based on their typing patterns. This approach allows for the creation of customized neural network architectures tailored to the specific requirements of the Typing Pattern Detection AI system.
By adopting a novel approach with the Keras Models Sequential, the project aims to achieve improved accuracy and performance in detecting typing patterns and authenticating users.

User’s Guide
Installation
The system should run on python 3.8. There is an requirements.txt file to make the package installations easier, with the required version for each one.
Activation
•	Once the test_model.py is activates, a screen of input will show. there the user will have to submit his name.
•	Then, another screen will appear, that asks if you want to record the input or not. *It is important to state that if the user chooses “yes”, the system will not predict the input, but just put it in the files. For the system to predict accurately the user must type 10,000+ characters.
•	If the user chooses “no” the system will predict the behavior by the inputted username. The user can choose rather to lock the screen after 10 fails or not by checking the box in the last window.
•	The system will detect edge cases such as not user inputs or model ready, and let the user know.
Personal summary / reflection
During the development of this project, I encountered both successes and challenges that contributed to my personal growth as a developer. The work process involved various stages, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and user interface development.

One of the major successes was successfully implementing the AI model using the Keras library. The model was able to effectively analyze and predict typing patterns based on the collected data. Additionally, the development of the user interface using Tkinter provided a visually appealing and interactive experience for the users.

However, I also faced some challenges and difficulties along the way. One of the challenges was selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task. Initially, I experimented with KNN and decision trees, but they didn't yield satisfactory results. It required further exploration and research to identify the suitable algorithm, which eventually led to the implementation of a sequential model in Keras.

The learning process throughout the project was extensive. I gained knowledge in areas such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and user interface development. I had to independently learn and understand concepts related to neural networks, specifically CNN and RNN architectures. This project allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills in machine learning and software development.

To continue the project, I plan to further explore different neural network architectures and optimization techniques to enhance the model's performance. Additionally, I will continue to stay updated with the latest advancements in machine learning and programming languages to incorporate new features and improve the overall system.

Throughout the project, I sought help from experts in the field of machine learning to gain insights and guidance. I also engaged in information sharing and peer learning through online forums and communities, which proved beneficial in overcoming obstacles and discovering new approaches.

In hindsight, if I had the opportunity to implement parts of the project differently, I would invest more time in the initial algorithm selection phase. Exploring a wider range of algorithms and conducting thorough experimentation could have potentially led to better initial results and saved time in the long run.

With additional resources, the project could be improved in various ways. Mostly by improving the user interface. At first it was planned to run on windows, but when I switched to Mac the UI didn’t cooperate. I had to adjust it by a short notice, and I think by having more time I could of improved the look of the final product.

Self-study questions for students to consider:

What other machine learning algorithms could be suitable for analyzing typing patterns?
How can data preprocessing techniques be applied to improve the model's performance?
Are there any other features or factors that could be considered in capturing and analyzing typing behavior?
How can the user interface be further enhanced to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience?
What other applications or domains could benefit from the analysis of typing patterns using AI?

I want to thank my friends that were there to help me and guide me when needed. I also want to thank my teachers that they were there around the clock.
